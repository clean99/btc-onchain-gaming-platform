<h1 align="center">Welcome to NFT metadata generator 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> A simple script to generate metadata for NFTs. You can generate generic metadata or dynamic metadata using this script.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
node index.js
```

Add your attributes into the attributes.json file. You can add attributes for every image. Thanks, [@DavGiac](https://github.com/DavGiac) for adding this feature.

If you want to generate unrevealed metadata for a collection, you can remove the dynamic URL of the image and replace it with an unrevealed image URL.

You can remove the attributes if you don't want to add traits and values.
